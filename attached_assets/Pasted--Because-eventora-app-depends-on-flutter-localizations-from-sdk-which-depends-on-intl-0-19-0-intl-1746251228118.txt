Because eventora_app depends on flutter_localizations from sdk which
  depends on intl 0.19.0, intl 0.19.0 is required.
So, because eventora_app depends on intl ^0.18.0, version solving failed.
Failed to update packages.
"flutter_localizations" is already in "dependencies". Will try to update the constraint.
Because eventora_app depends on flutter_localizations any which doesn't
  exist (could not find package flutter_localizations at https://pub.dev),
  version solving failed.

Your project is configured with Android NDK 26.3.11579264, but the following plugin(s) depend on a different Android NDK version:
- flutter_localization requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
- shared_preferences_android requires Android NDK 27.0.12077973
Fix this issue by using the highest Android NDK version (they are backward compatible).
Add the following to /Users/dell/Development/Daoob/flutter_project_download/eventora_app/android/app/build.gradle.kts:

    android {
        ndkVersion = "27.0.12077973"
        ...
    }
